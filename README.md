# Satellite Image Classification

This document covers the classification of landmarks by using the captured images from the satellite Sentinel-2. Different modelling techniques are used for classification problem. In this work, within a total of 27,000 categorized and geo-referenced images, the linked dataset includes 13 spectral bands and consists of 10 classes. In this report, we investigated the approaches for using multilayer perceptron (MLP) network and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify labeled satellite images with supervised learning. Our best approach achieved 81.75% accuracy.
